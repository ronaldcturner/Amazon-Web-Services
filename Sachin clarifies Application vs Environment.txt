(00:51:47) You are now chatting with Sachin A..

(00:51:55) Sachin A. can now only view the customer's screen.

(00:51:59) Sachin A. said to you:
Hello Ron

(00:52:10) Sachin A. said to you:
Good evening!

(00:52:17) You said to Sachin A.:
Hi Sachin. I'll tidy up a bit.

(00:52:48) Sachin A. said to you:
ok.. :)

(00:54:01) You said to Sachin A.:
I created a Marcus-APP, which I think has collided with the environment name. I can show you the CLI eb commands.

(00:54:12) Sachin A. said to you:
Ok..

(00:55:00) You said to Sachin A.:
The good build is now sitting in the REV5 folder

(00:55:18) Sachin A. said to you:
From where you copied the code to REV5

(00:55:36) Sachin A. said to you:
from the file app-xxxxxx or from other directory ?

(00:55:50) Sachin A. said to you:
ok.

(00:56:26) You said to Sachin A.:
No. Wait, I moved the downloded .zip into the new directory and THEN unzipped the contents there.

(00:56:41) Sachin A. said to you:
ok.. Cool

(00:56:56) You said to Sachin A.:
and here is the new and improved .ebextensions folder!

(00:57:23) Sachin A. said to you:
ok.. have you made any changes within the file(s) ?

(00:58:29) You said to Sachin A.:
After the REV5 deploy, I then edited settings.py with the new ALLOWED_HOSTS value. No other changed.

(00:58:43) You said to Sachin A.:
the app DID deploy properly otherwise.

(00:59:10) Sachin A. said to you:
on CMD line can you execute command "eb list"

(00:59:55) Sachin A. said to you:
So whenever you are doing any "eb deploy" those will be applied to REV3

(01:00:05) Sachin A. said to you:
any changes*

(01:00:34) Sachin A. said to you:
did you initialize in this new directory REV5 (eb init) ?

(01:00:52) You said to Sachin A.:
So THAT's the meaing of the "*". Yes, I did init.

(01:01:19) Sachin A. said to you:
ok..

(01:01:32) Sachin A. said to you:
Yes.. "*" (Star) indicates the active environment to which the changes will be applied

(01:01:47) You said to Sachin A.:
Very glad to know that.

(01:03:24) Sachin A. said to you:
I am also thinking on how to directly pass the beanstalk URL to your settings.py

(01:04:03) Sachin A. said to you:
May be if we are successful in creating an environment variable then you don't have to manually keep the track of allowed hosts.

(01:04:26) You said to Sachin A.:
I follow, and that would be wonderful.

(01:04:52) Sachin A. said to you:
Let me quickly check..

(01:06:39) You said to Sachin A.:
This is one (terrible) way to make things easy: ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['*'].

(01:07:44) Sachin A. said to you:
Yes..

(01:08:12) Sachin A. said to you:
one moment. I am checking few things in my lab environment.

(01:10:51) You said to Sachin A.:
I think it only takes an "eb use". I did that to change the active environment.

(01:11:11) You said to Sachin A.:
. . . and am trying another deploy

(01:12:48) Sachin A. said to you:
Yes..

(01:13:04) Sachin A. said to you:
"eb use" can be used to switched between environments

(01:13:14) Sachin A. said to you:
sorry for typos..

(01:13:40) Sachin A. said to you:
eb list

(01:13:56) You said to Sachin A.:
IT worked!

(01:15:00) You said to Sachin A.:
Yes. that works. So I should only have to "use" the right environment.

(01:15:10) Sachin A. said to you:
Yes..

(01:15:36) Sachin A. said to you:
before execute "eb deploy" always check the current active environment

(01:16:24) You said to Sachin A.:
All right. Now I think I can finally do a from-scratch build. But will you help me "kill" this REV5 so that I can start fresh with a name that I really want.

(01:16:41) Sachin A. said to you:
Sure..

(01:16:51) Sachin A. said to you:
Ron, can we wait for a min..

(01:17:05) Sachin A. said to you:
I am trying to create an environment variable

(01:17:19) You said to Sachin A.:
Sorry I just diverted from the possibility of not having to edit, then re-deploy. I see... I'll follow you.

(01:17:33) Sachin A. said to you:
With which you don't have to manually track the allowed hosts

(01:17:55) Sachin A. said to you:
automatically it will just all the CNAME of the beanstalk URL..

(01:18:09) You said to Sachin A.:
That smells like having to mess with Django, but I'll watch you carefully.

(01:19:39) Sachin A. said to you:
meanwhile if you have any questions, feel free to post them in chat.. I will try to answer them at the end.

(01:19:50) You said to Sachin A.:
... which for this one would be Marcus-APP.us-west-2.elasticbeanstalk.com

(01:21:41) You said to Sachin A.:
I get it (I think). I can predict the CNAME beforehand, based on what I know I will enter for the DNS CNAME prefix, right?

(01:23:21) Sachin A. said to you:
Yes.. :)

(01:23:48) You said to Sachin A.:
Got it. It's an editing procedure.... everyting done in order.

(01:25:08) Sachin A. said to you:
Shall we proceed with creation of the new environment and delete all your old resources ?

(01:25:55) You said to Sachin A.:
Yes please. And I confess that I ALWAYS get confused with the Web dashboards. But I'll follow.

(01:26:49) Sachin A. said to you:
no issues.. I  will assist you..

(01:27:27) Sachin A. said to you:
before we proceed if you have any query related to terminologies such as application, environment etc.. feel free to ask me

(01:28:24) You said to Sachin A.:
OK, by example, here are the two consoles:

(01:29:38) Sachin A. said to you:
ok

(01:30:34) You said to Sachin A.:
"All Applications" will list the applications, of which there are only one (the large font at the tope, right?)

(01:31:44) Sachin A. said to you:
Let me try to find a screenshot on google to clarify you in better way.. one moment

(01:33:39) Sachin A. said to you:
https://d1.awsstatic.com/Getting%20Started/update-an-app/Getting-Started-EB2-green_box.f7b981fbc3ac7574f925ca30b2f6cc9022ae6c53.png

(01:33:45) Sachin A. said to you:
can you pls open this link..

(01:34:20) Sachin A. said to you:
I think you have to copy and paste directely in browser

(01:35:05) Sachin A. said to you:
Here there are TWO application. 
1. "My First Beastic beanstalk
2. PHP-Sample-app

(01:35:07) You said to Sachin A.:
Got it.

(01:35:26) Sachin A. said to you:
1st application has ZERO environments in it

(01:35:52) Sachin A. said to you:
where as application php-sample-app has ONE environment in it.

(01:36:39) Sachin A. said to you:
In short, An application is container of environments..

(01:37:19) Sachin A. said to you:
Here usually our customer have xyz-test, xyz-staging, xyz-prod

(01:37:30) Sachin A. said to you:
under a single application "xyz"

(01:37:38) You said to Sachin A.:
THAT'S where I've been stubbornly dense. I thought that applications were INSIDE environments

(01:38:03) You said to Sachin A.:
VERY nice "best practices"

(01:38:31) Sachin A. said to you:
hope that clarifies your query on apps and env's

(01:39:11) You said to Sachin A.:
I'm pointed in the right direction and will study further. I'll capture your dialogue and come back to it.

(01:40:39) Sachin A. said to you:
One important point.. 
You should always plan to design your application to handle failures.

(01:41:22) Sachin A. said to you:
Say, if the underlying hardware goes wrong.. then auto scaling will replace the faulty instance with a new one.. (all the day will be wiped)

(01:42:34) You said to Sachin A.:
I have the long list of references that came when I chose auto-scaling. I have yet to get to that.

(01:42:35) Sachin A. said to you:
So you have to store the data either on a DB (AWS RDS), Dynamo DB or S3..

(01:44:48) You said to Sachin A.:
I see. And I'll pursue. This demystifies a lot of the "magic" that I've never understood about the cloud. It also gives us a lot of confidence in providing fail-over for critical cloud apps..... all under our control.
