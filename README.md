# Amazon-Web-Services
Totally unorganized but extremely valuable survival kit of cheat sheets, lessons learned and other urgent detail.
Our initial migration of demos from RedHat Python SaaS to AWS Elastic Benstalk was painful. Ron spent several weeks scavenging tips from SO on his own. After enrolling in Premium Support, AWS hovered closely to resolve every cloud-side problem. Some problems were AWS-side and required research--even customized code--on AWS' side. Even with skilled support people on our case and even with real-time chat, there was a lot of trial and error.
Everything that occurred during that run-up (for our clinicaltrials deployment) was reained and stored in Ron's Amazon Web Services folder. This repo is a simple dump of that folder.
These notes (CLI script captures, above all) are invaluable for deploying new demos.
